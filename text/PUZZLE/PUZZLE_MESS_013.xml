    <Original>[0]Hey, wait... Is that Mom and Dad?[1]"Raised in the South, he was a man of [2]enormous presence. He was hailed as a genius[3]by the scientific community after publishing[4]his thesis in his late twenties.[5]It was not only his fame but also his great[6]charisma that drew others to him.[7]He took up the position of Director at MJ[8]Labs, a company set up for him, in 1984.[9]It was an advanced memory research facility, [10]with government VIPs on the board of [11]directors, which recruited only the brightest[12]American graduates as researchers.[13]Everyone who ever worked with Judd [14]agreed that he was able to evaluate the[15]potential of these promising young scientists[16]almost immediately, and within a short period[17]of time he would push them beyond what they[18]believed to be their own limits.[19]Judd had the ability and the charm to [20]convince even the people who worked with[21]him that they were geniuses, but there was[22]another side to him as well.[23]If he didn't get on with someone for any [24]reason, he would be coldly indifferent to them."[25]"The photograph shows Judd's researchers[26]during his time at MJ Labs.[27]Standing on left: Sayoko Kitazato[28]Standing centre: Richard Robins[29]Standing behind Judd: Rex Alfred"[30]</Original>
