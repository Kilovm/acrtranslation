There's something I want to tell you about your 
mother. I'll be waiting for you at Lake Juliet.

Getting ready for camping has taken longer than I 
thought, so I can't pick you up. I'll wait at the 
campsite, so go ahead and check in at the guesthouse.[0]</Original>

I've got a few more things to do here. I'm really
sorry but I won't have time to go to the campsite
now - can you get my backpack and bring it back to
the cottage for me, please?

My cottage is past the covered bridge, on the left.[0]</Original>

Ashley, I'm so happy I had the chance to go camping
with you.

I want you to know more about the area, so I'm
sending you these Lake Juliet messages. They're
timed to arrive while you're here camping, so I 
hope you enjoy reading them.

I heard this story at the photographer's the first time
I came to Lake Juliet.

It's a tragic love story connected to the Romeo 
Mountains and Lake Juliet.

"Once upon a time, a poor boy from the mountains 
and a girl from the lake fell in love. The boy found a
stone that shone with all the colours of the rainbow
and, thinking that if he could sell it to afford their
marriage, he happily came down from the mountain.
But he was in such a hurry that he slipped and fell to
his death on the valley floor. The kind-hearted girl 
was heartbroken and followed her love by throwing
herself into the lake. Their families, who had at first 
opposed the relationship, grieved for their losses. They 
found the rainbow stone and cast it into the lake.
Since that day, mysterious rainbow stones appeared
in the Romeo Mountains mines."

They say that if a couple find one of these stones,
they are destined to be together forever.[0]</Original>

The mines in the Romeo Mountains are closed now,
but this is their story.

"Gold was discovered in the Romeo Mountains in the
1920s, and the owner of the mines became fabulously
wealthy. He pumped huge amounts of water up from
Lake Juliet to wash the gold, and the dirty water
went straight back into the lake. Beautiful Lake Juliet
became polluted, and the livelihoods of people living
nearby were threatened. After the gold ran out and
the mines closed, the lake returned to its former
beauty."

It would be a tragedy for pollution to hit a lake as
beautiful as Lake Juliet.[0]</Original>

Ashley, have you seen the mermaid statue?
It's part of the next chapter in that sad story
about Lake Juliet and the Romeo Mountains.

"They say that the girl threw herself into Lake
Juliet after her love died and became a mermaid 
protecting the lake. There's a legend that on nights
with a full moon, she thinks of her lost love and
weeps.

They say that if a couple sees those tears in the 
moonlight, they'll be able to keep their love forever."

I've never seen a mermaid, but the moon over Lake
Juliet is beautiful.[0]</Original>

One thing you have to mention when talking about
Lake Juliet is the Salmon Rice Burger at Bob's 
diner. It's my favourite, a really delicious burger.

Bob is the restaurant owner, he's a really friendly
guy. I heard he used to sing for a country music
band, and I told him about not being able to live
without a guitar in my hand when I was younger.
We've had some great talks together - maybe it's
because we're about the same age, but we always end 
up talking about jazz going out of fashion. Bob says 
maybe we should get with the program now that rock 
is becoming popular again.

Let's go to Bob's diner together sometime.[0]</Original>

JC Valley, where I work, is built on the shore of Lake
Juliet. I want to show you that unusual underwater
building.

I'm doing memory research again with some people I
worked with at MJ Labs, where I met your mother.


Ryan Gray
He still looks like the boy I first met, but he's a
scientific genius. He's very strict about his work, but
you can see that he's not satisfied with his methods.
Listening to him, you get the impression he's 
obsessed with the genius of Judd and Sayoko.

Rex Alfred
Rex is the person who brought me to JC Valley. He's
looking forward to seeing his daughter when she
comes home on holiday from boarding school.
Hearing that, I remembered that I haven't been home
to see you in almost six months.
Rex took over JC Valley from its founder, Judd 
Fitzgerald, and is preoccupied with doing everything
he can to expand the company.[0]</Original>
