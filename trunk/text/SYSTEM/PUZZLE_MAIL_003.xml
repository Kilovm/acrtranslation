    <Original>Mike Tyler[0]Magazine interview[0]Dr Robins, sorry to bother you on your day
off. Do you remember the magazine that
asked to do an article on us last week? They
need an answer today. I have the director's
permission for photography in the lab, so are
you available for an interview?
Please let me know.
                                       Mike[0]</Original>

    <Original>Jessica Robins[0]Call me![0]Richard,
Please call me as soon as you get this! 
When are you coming home? Ashley's doing
well, but she always seems a little bit lonely - 
probably because she hasn't seen you for so
long. She's at an awkward age now. She 
spends so much time locked up in her room,
and she doesn't talk to me as freely as she
used to. 
I know you're busy with your work, but come
to see us soon. Ashley misses you.

    <Original>Rex Alfred[0]JC Valley[0]Richard, 
I'm delighted you've accepted the position at
JC Valley. I honestly didn't think we'd have a
chance to work together again. 
If you're here with us, I'm sure we can 
successfully complete that last project of 
Judd's. We await your speedy arrival!
